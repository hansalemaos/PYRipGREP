# PYRipGREP
Use the insanely fast regex engine RIPGREP https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep as a python module! Search results are converted directly to dict/numpy/pandas/generator

You can use the class PyRipGREP as you would use ripgrep, but you will get a string as result. Because of that I created the class RePatterns where your results are converted in a format that allows you to work with big datasets!
